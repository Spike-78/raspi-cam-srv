                    A number representing the native Bayer order of sensor 
                    (before any rotation is taken into account).
                </td>
                {% elif prop == "Location" %}
                <td>
                    An integer which specifies where on the device the camera is 
                    situated (for example, front or back). For the Raspberry Pi, 
                    the value has no meaning.

                {% elif prop == "PixelArrayActiveAreas" %}
                <td>
                    The active area of the sensor’s pixel array within the entire sensor pixel array. 
                    Given as a tuple of (x_offset, y_offset, width, height) values.
                </td>
                {% elif prop == "PixelArraySize" %}
                <td>
                    The size of the active pixel area as an (x, y) tuple. 
                    This is the full available resolution of the sensor.
                </td>
                {% elif prop == "Rotation" %}
                <td>
                    The rotation of the sensor relative to the camera board. 
                    On many Raspberry Pi devices, the sensor is actually upside down 
                    when the camera board is held with the connector at the bottom, 
                    and these will return a value of 180° here.
                </td>
                {% elif prop == "ScalerCropMaximum" %}
                <td>
                    This value is updated when a camera mode is configured. 
                    It returns the rectangle as a (x_offset, y_offset, width, height) tuple 
                    within the pixel area active area, that is read out by this camera mode.
                </td>
                {% elif prop == "SensorSensitivity" %}
                <td>
                    This value is updated when a camera mode is configured. 
                    It represents a relative sensitivity of this camera mode compared to 
                    other camera modes. Usually, camera modes all have the same sensitivity 
                    so that the same exposure time and gain yield an image of the same brightness. 
                    Sometimes cameras have modes where this is not true, and to get the same 
                    brightness you would have to adjust the total requested exposure by the ratio 
                    of these sensitivities. For most sensors this will always return 1.0.
                </td>
                {% elif prop == "UnitCellSize" %}
                <td>
                    The physical size of this sensor’s pixels, if known. 
                    Given as an (x, y) tuple in units of nanometres.
                </td>
