# Release Notes

## V2.1.0
- Added endpoint for photo snapshots ([raspi-cam-srv Issue #5](https://github.com/signag/raspi-cam-srv/issues/5))  
(see [Web Cam](./Webcam.md))

## V2.0.0

- Major modification of camera control to allow non-exclusive access to the camera from parallel tasks.   
Phototaking, video recording and photoseries do no longer interrupt the live stream if the required camera configurations are compatible.    
(See [raspiCamSrv Tasks and Background Processes](./Background%20Processes.md))
- Added code generation to the camera module.   
The code used for interaction of **raspiCamSrv** with Picamera2 is logged into a file specific for each server run. This generates executable Python code, suitable to 'replay' the entire camera interaction of a raspiCam Server run.    
This can be used for testing and error analysis.   
(See [Generation of Python Code for Camera](./Troubelshooting.md#generation-of-python-code-for-camera))
- General refactoring of "Timelapse series" to "Photo Series".   
Timelapse series are now just a special kind of photo series.
- The folder ```raspi-cam-srv/raspiCamSrv/static/timelapse``` is no longer used.   
Instead, photo series are now stored in folder ```raspi-cam-srv/raspiCamSrv/static/photoseries```   
This folder will be automatically created at the first server start.   
If you have stored photoseries under the ```timelapse``` folder, you can move them to the ```photoseries``` folder and then delete the ```timelapse``` folder.   
For each series, you need to exchange ```/timelapse/``` with ```/photoseries/``` in the ```*_cfg.json``` files
- The camera configuration for VIDEO is now initialized with the sensor mode with the largest stream size in order to allow simultaneous use of main stream for Photo and Video.
